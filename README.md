# Resume Screening Classifier

An AI-powered resume screening model built using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks, designed to classify tech resumes into "Accepted" or "Rejected" categories. This project automates the resume filtering process for recruitment purposes, particularly for roles such as Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, AI Specialist, Cybersecurity Analyst, and Software Engineer.
